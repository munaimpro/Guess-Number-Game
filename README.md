# Guess-Number-Game
This is a simple guess number game created using HTML, Bootstrap and JavaScript

## üìù Description

I created this game using HTML5, Bootstrap and JavaScript. You can input any number you want within predefined range and get the result.
Not only result, but also position. Position will be calculated based on your attempt number. If you can guess the right number within very
fiew attempt, you will won the first position. Similarly 2nd and 3rd position based on your attempt number. Definitely there will have
different types of celebration process with different sound effects.
